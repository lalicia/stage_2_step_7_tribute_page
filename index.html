      <h3>This page is a tribute to the one I can always rely on to check-in on me; a provider of entertainment, education, and distraction; the one who has seen me at my best and at my worst, yet never judged me; and - I am not afraid to admit - the only reason I get out of bed sometimes (because I don't like watching TV lying down - don't @ me).
        <br><br>I give to you...</h3>

        <p>To adequately glorify Netflix one must first understand the pre-Netflix landscape, as believe it or not, we didn't always inhabit a world where countless serial killer documentaries and drama mini-series were accessible at the touch - or click - of a few buttons, any time, night or day.</p>
        
        <p>Let me set the scene...</p>
        
        <p>Once upon a time, there were only four channels (I'm aware at some point in history there were only three channels, but a line has to be drawn, y'know?) - and at night, they actually <em>stopped</em> broadcasting.  Like, no shows.  Honestly, I'm being deadly serious with you right now.  You used to get this creepy image as a placeholder for where the shows should be: 
          <br>
          <img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/4/20/1334931875120/BBC-test-card-F-featuring-008.jpg?width=620&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=cc16412c9d55afcb766ff77419065970" alt="Testcard designed to live in your subconcious and vaguely bother you for the rest of your life">
          
          <p>So not only did you have nothing to watch, you were also probably going to have nightmares, because honestly <em>what</em> is that image about?  But I digress...</p>
        
        <p>In terms of films, you either went to the cinema to see a film when it was released, waited for someone to buy the video when it came out, or waited even longer and recorded it off the telly at Christmas.  <em>Or</em> - and this is where Netflix lurks, waiting to break onto the timeline - you rented the video from a shop.</p>
        
        <p>Anyone old enough to remember those heady days of physical video rental shops?  The one near me was called Jack Beanstalk.  I don't know why - maybe because opening the door was akin to reaching the top of the stalk and finding oneself in a wonderful new land...  In this case, a land filled with tacky, beaten-up, chipped plastic cases for VHS tapes, half of which had no cover image so you had to go on trust that this would all work out and you'd end up with the right film.  Oh - and really expensive bags of sweets, because it's one of the laws of the universe that if you deal with movies in any way, shape, or form, then you must seriously overcharge for confectionary.</p>
        
        <p>But then a few things happened all at once.  Welcome to 1997.</p>
        
        <p>Now, in quite important order:
          <span>
          <ul>
            <li>Firstly, we got a fifth channel!  Woo!  Channel 5!  Actually not that important in respect of Netflix, but it felt important at the time...</li>
            <li>Secondly, and definitely more importantly, DVDs came out.</li>
            <li>And thirdly, within 6 months of DVDs becomming a thing, Netflix was born.</li>
          </ul>
          </span>
        </p>
          
        <p>Some of you may not know this, but Netflix wasn't always an app where you just picked something to watch on your phone/laptop/TV/etc and streamed it directly into your eyeballs on impulse.  Nope - to begin with, Netflix was basically a mail-order video rental shop.  You picked what you wanted to see, requested it, and Netflix <em>posted</em> it out to you.  Are you old enough to remember when Netflix posted out DVDs?  Come to think of it, are you old enough to remember DVDs, or am I lapsing into jargon here..?  Shiny circle things that look the same as CDs.  What's a CD?  Er - sometimes people use them as coasters...</p>
        
        <p>No?  Never mind.  I'll just sit here and be old quietly.</p>
     
        <p>Netflix would continue as a mail-order DVD rental company for another decade.  I lived it, and even I'm surprised it was that long...  But yes, the first films made available to stream on Netflix didn't hit the internet until 2007.</p>
      
        <p>From there, I don't think much explanation is necessary.  Popularity boomed for obvious reasons: getting what you wanted when you wanted it.  Give me Tom Hanks NOWWWWWWW.  I need When Harry Met Sally IMMEDIATELY or I am going to flail and diiiiie.  If I don't get to watch Jurassic Park in the next five minutes, then I'm going to lose my tiny mind!</p>
        
        <p>You get the gist.  Supply and demand.</p>
      
        <p>But then Netflix went a step further and started making <strong>their own</strong> content.  In 2013 they debuted original programming, most notably with a little show called Orange is the New Black.  And well, they never looked back.  Now, it's hard to imagine Netflix not having their own shows and movies - a lot of the streaming favs are made up of original programs, such as Stranger Things, The Crown, The Witcher...  And as much as not everyone may love Netflix, it's hard to imagine that many have gone without hearing about at least one of these shows.  In 2021, Netflix won 7 of their 36 Academy Award nominations, and Emmys (American TV awards)?  They won 44.</p>
      
        <p>I considered putting a massive fangirl list of everything I love on Netflix right now, but honestly I don't think that would best serve anybody.  Not me, who would have to type it out - and definitely not you, who should instead go take a look at Netflix yourself and pick something tasty to watch...  Order the sweets on your Asda shopping and boom, perfection.</p>
      
        <p>I'll just take this opportunity to assure you all I am not ad-affiliated at all.  I just genuinely am this into Netflix.</p>
      
        <p>So is that it - has Netflix hit peak?  Well, no, it has not.  What next? - I hear you cry!  Well, the next chapter for Netflix looks to be gaming, with a number of announcements about forthcoming expansion into that arena.  So in short order, you should be able to switch seamlessly from shooting, I dunno - zombies or something - to watching a zombie movie, no change of app required.</p>
        
        <p>I mean - I already love you, Netflix...the fact that you keep trying to get better just really touches me.  And seriously, in a world where so many things seem to get worse, Netflix is a shiny example of something that doesn't.</p>

        <p>Now, if your geek/history bone has been tickled and you fancy reading up a little more on the wonder-that-is Netflix, here's the <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a> where you can check I'm not just making this all up in some kind of fever dream and pulling random dates out of thin air ;)</p> <!-- _blank ensures opens in a new page as per the instructions/hint -->
      
        <p>I won't link Netflix itself as honestly I don't want to break some unwritten rule about flogging stuff, even accidentally lol</p>
